  <h1>How do you get <i>compile-time</i> evaluation?</h1>

  <p>
    The previous example failed at runtime. How do you implement a string
    interpolator that fails at compile time, the way the "f" interpolator
    does?
  </p>

  <p class="fragment">
    Short answer: Compiler macros.
  </p>

  <p class="fragment">
    Macros can be quite complicated. They expose the compiler's AST, and
    the macro writer is often required to manipulate the AST and perform
    type-level programming.
